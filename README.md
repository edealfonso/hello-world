# hello-world

I am an Engineer, Musician and I love programming.
I was born on 1984 and live in Barcelona.

My experience with programming so far:
  - I had Pascal courses in my school as a kid
  - I did very simple web pages in my early teens, I just remember one of my favourite band Joy Division
  - I won a printer in a C++ contest that my school organized for Spanish teens
  - I did lots of MATLAB patches and FORTRAN programs in my PhD research in Nuclear Physics
  - I learned audio language Max/MSP to do a couple of artistic projects
  - I started studing a Master on Web Programming on UOC in 2020, which I'm still at
  - I started working in Maneko Estudio in Barcelona as a Junior Programming assistant on 2021

I'm here to learn and share.

Feel free to write me :-)
