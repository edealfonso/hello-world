# hello-world

I am an Engineer, Musician and I love programming
I was born on 1984 and live in Barcelona

I did my own webpages as a kid, 
then won a priter in a teen contest in C++,
did lots of Matlab patches and Fortran programs in my PhD research in Nuclear Physics, 
learned audio interfacing language Max/MSP,
improved my skills in CSS and JavaScript for my own business official site

And I'm here to learn and share some of my projects

Right now I'm interested in Machine Learning, will probably focus on the Reinforcement Learning using Python and MATLAB <3

Feel free to write me :-)
